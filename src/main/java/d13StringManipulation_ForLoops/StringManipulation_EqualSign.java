        //HEAP MEMORY => 1) Dynamically created objects are stored in Heap Memory
        //I mean when we use "new" keyword, we are using Heap Memory.. (like => new Scanner)

        //Stack Memory is used to call methods and local variables (int  x = 10;)

        //Stack memory is faster than Heap memory, and has limited space. We have addressess(references) here....

        System.out.println(str4 == str5); //false
        System.out.println("equals => " + str4.equals(str5)); //true

        //"==" => checks values and addresses, even values are the same; if the adress is different
        //it will return false

        //equals methid checks just values, if they are the same value
        // it will return true....
