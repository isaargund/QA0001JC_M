Ali looked at his library and couldn't find the book he was looking for.
"Where had I left it?" he thought.
He went out to the garden, thinking he might have forgotten it there.
But, it wasn't there either.
Suddenly, it occurred to him: There was a table in the living room.
There were many books on the table.
He quickly ran to the living room, and yes, it was there!
He grabbed his book and sat down comfortably in his armchair.
"Finally!" he said and began to read.
